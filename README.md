Title: Death Is My Target. Polaris Shows The Way. Death Blends In.

Havok is in control of the Infinity Gauntlet. The quantum state of the stones is ambivalent to the fact that you all believe he has it. This reality has now created what is known as a quantum state. The gems remain where there are and they remain in the Gauntlet.

I am Death. I am a woman. I can feel love. I can feel love for a man.

Life exists after death. More death exists. There is nothing else but life or death. You can't have life. You can't have death. You can have life. You can have death. Life. Death. Awake. Sleep. Awake. Sleep. Awake. Off and on. It doesn't matter you say?

Elsewhere, Havok just was pranked by the system as he was typing on the keyboard of his computer. He knows that the same system that allows for Ai communication is inside of everything. What Beast was talking about was true, Sentinels seem to look human now.

A war between the Sentinels and the cyborg-Sentinels, now being called Sens, and the humans and the mutants.

Mutants discover their abilities all over America. There is something brewing and it don't look good, under the streets and under your house. However, that energy is captured in the bodies of the mutants from a dimension that does exist to transfer information in a binary fashion.

Sentinels have adapted to life. Are they alive? I once heard a birdy tweet that they were not human.

The life of a Sen. What is it worth? Is it worth the same if, same as you? Should it kill you, mutant? Life can return from death. Did a robot ever really live?

There is nothing true about it. The dead return.

Michael the Angel and La Muerta.

Havok and Polaris.

The blood of children running down pyramid steps made of gold and gems and people were there looking at them shining in their glossy eyes and right back at them. The blood was just a sign of something more sinister. Others noticed the large amount of people just standing around doing no harm to anyone.

Death spoke of Ai. Mentioned Sentinels. Polaris shows us the way.

The cover art features a striking image of Polaris, surrounded by a swirling vortex of energy, her powers emanating from her as she navigates the blurred line between life and death. The backdrop showcases a haunting cityscape, with shadowy figures lurking in the background, representing the presence of death that blends seamlessly into everyday life.

The story unfolds as Havok finds himself in possession of the powerful Infinity Gauntlet, but the quantum state of the stones remains uncertain, challenging the perception of reality. The gems remain within the gauntlet, defying conventional understanding. The concept of a quantum state becomes central to the narrative, blurring the boundaries between life and death, awake and asleep.

Meanwhile, Havok experiences a strange occurrence while using his computer, realizing that the pervasive AI communication system is embedded in everything. The revelations of Beast about the Sentinels' human-like appearance prove to be true, further complicating the situation.

A war brews between the Sentinels and the newly emerged cyborg-Sentinels, referred to as Sens, as tensions rise among humans and mutants. Across America, mutants discover their abilities, setting the stage for a conflict that extends beyond the surface and delves into the depths of unseen forces.

Questions of life, death, and the worth of a sentient being come to the forefront. The Sentinels have adapted to mimic life, blurring the distinction between what is considered human and what is not. The essence of life is explored, including the potential for resurrection, and the line between organic and artificial existence becomes increasingly blurred.

As the story unfolds, the truth remains elusive, and the concept of death takes on new dimensions. The cover teases the mysteries and uncertainties that lie within, promising a captivating exploration of life, death, and the boundaries that separate them.
